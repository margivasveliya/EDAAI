-->Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project  

This is  beginner-friendly EDA script written in Python.  
It helps understand a dataset using numbers (statistics) and pictures (graphs).  
It’s very simple, and I have added lots of comments so it’s easy to follow.

--> What this program does
-  Loads a CSV file into Python  
-  Shows the first few rows of the data  
-  Gives basic statistics like mean, median, std, min, max, etc.  
-  Draws histograms for each numeric column  
-  Draws boxplots to see data spread and outliers  
-  Creates a pairplot to see relationships between columns  
-  Shows a correlation heatmap
-  Makes a small interactive scatter plot (with Plotly)  
- Prints some simple insights
